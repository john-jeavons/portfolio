Create a personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS. The site should be responsive and visually appealing, with a clean and modern layout. It must include the following sections:

Home/Landing Page – A brief welcome message, name, and a short tagline or description.

About Me – A section with a photo (placeholder is fine), a short bio, and a list of skills.

Projects – Showcase 3–6 projects with titles, descriptions, and links (can be dummy links).

Contact – A simple contact form (non-functional, no JavaScript), or a list of contact methods like email, LinkedIn, or GitHub.

Navigation Bar – Fixed or responsive, allowing users to jump to different sections or pages.

Additional requirements:

Use semantic HTML5 elements.

Style everything using CSS3 — no JavaScript or frameworks.

Make sure the site looks good on both desktop and mobile devices (responsive design).

You may include Google Fonts or basic icons using HTML/CSS.

Keep the code clean, readable, and well-structured.
